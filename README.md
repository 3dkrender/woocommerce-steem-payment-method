# WooCommerce Steem
Accept Steem payments directly to your WooCommerce shop!

## Supported Steem Currencies
- Steem (STEEM)
- Steem Backed Dollars (SBD)

## Limitation
- Currently supports different fiat currencies such as: AUD, BGN, BRL, CAD, CHF, CNY, CZK, DKK, GBP, HKD, HRK, HUF, IDR, ILS, INR, JPY, KRW, MXN, MYR, NOK, NZD, PHP, PLN, RON, RUB, SEK, SGD, THB, TRY, ZAR, EUR

## How does it confirm Steem Transfers?
It uses WordPress CRON every 5 minutes to call WooCommerce orders that uses payment method as Steem and calls an API via Steemful (Another application I'm building around WordPress ecosystem) powered by SteemSQL.

## Note
You will <strong>NOT</strong> require any Steem keys for this plugin to work. You just have to provide your Steem username and you're good to go.
